It allows the developer to describe requests and the responses those requests are expected to generate using a simple JSON or YAML document. Since Gimbal ships as a single, compiled binary it is easy to run in a variety of cases, including during a CI build process. It can also be scheduled using `cron` or similar.\r\n\r\n### Why \"Gimbal\"\r\n[Gimbals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal) help sailors, photographers, astronauts, and others keep their tools properly aligned.
