{"name":"Gimbal","tagline":"An HTTP testing system","body":"### Introduction\r\nGimbal is designed for testing HTTP APIs (REST or otherwise) and web sites. It allows the developer to describe requests and the responses those requests are expected to generate using a simple JSON or YAML document. Since Gimbal ships as a single, compiled binary it is easy to run in a variety of cases, including during a CI build process. It can also be scheduled using `cron` or similar.\r\n\r\n### Example Test Suite\r\nBelow is an extremely simple (trivially so) test suite for use with Gimbal. If you'd like to see a more complete example, check out [httpbin.json](https://github.com/Datamaglia/gimbal/blob/master/examples/httpbin.json), which tests a number of the [httpbin](http://httpbin.org/) endpoints. For now, let's take a quick look at the simple example.\r\n\r\nA Gimbal test suite is defined using a JSON file (YAML and other formats will be supported soon). The configuration is called a \"spec\". Specs are recursive, they can contain other specs. Configuration options contained in the parent are pushed down into the children. This forms a kind of tree, of which only the leaf nodes will actually result in HTTP requests.\r\n\r\nEach spec can describe an HTTP request and the response that is expected back. There are also some additional parameters, like how many times a request should be attempted before giving up. A request can be minimally specified by a `host` (which will result in a request for the URI `/`). The host will be inherited by child specs, which means you can define it just once on the parent and then specify URIs on the children.\r\n\r\n```{json}\r\n{\r\n    \"host\": \"gimbal.datamaglia.com\",\r\n    \"maxAttempts\": 1,\r\n    \"name\": \"Simple Tests\",\r\n    \"specs\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"root\",\r\n            \"responseHeaders\": {\r\n                \"Content-Type\": [\r\n                    \"text/html; charset=utf-8\"\r\n                ]\r\n            },\r\n            \"statusCode\": 200,\r\n            \"uri\": \"/\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"name\": \"404\",\r\n            \"responseHeaders\": {\r\n                \"Content-Type\": [\r\n                    \"text/html; charset=utf-8\"\r\n                ]\r\n            },\r\n            \"statusCode\": 404,\r\n            \"uri\": \"/404\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA couple things to point out. First, notice that the header value is a list. This is in case there are multiple instance of a given header. All values are included in a single key (to make it valid JSON). Next, and probably self-explanatory, the `statusCode` key asserts which status code we expect back from the request.\r\n\r\n### Building\r\nRight now Gimbal is under heavy development and there aren't any releases. However, you can try it out by cloning the repository (see the link the left) and building it yourself. First, you'll need a functioning Go toolchain. There are [instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install) on the Go web site. The [Go article](http://howistart.org/posts/go/1) at \"How I Start\" is also an excellent read if you want to become more familiar with how Go development \"works\".\r\n\r\nOnce you've got that set up, you can run `go get github.com/datamaglia/gimbal` to grab the repo (or fork it and change the GitHub path to your fork). Switch to the source directory and run `go get && go build` and you'll have a binary in no time. Then you can run one of the examples. Try `./gimbal -f examples/httpbin.json`.\r\n\r\n### Why \"Gimbal\"\r\n[Gimbals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal) help sailors, photographers, astronauts, and others keep their tools properly aligned. Gimbal helps developers keep their production systems aligned with their specifications.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
